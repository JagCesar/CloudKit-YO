CloudKit-YO
===========

##What is it?

A YO copy using CloudKit, just to play around with CloudKit.

I'm aware that the code looks terrible and that I could make it a LOT cleaner. I just want to get all functionality there before I start refactoring. If you want to help out, feel free to open a pull request :)
